# Definition of Done (D.o.D)

Below is the DoD framework for our project:

## General Criteria
- Code is thoroughly reviewed and approved by at least one other team member.
- All unit tests and integration tests pass without errors.
- Code follows the established coding standards and best practices.
- Code is pushed to the GitHub repository with clear, descriptive commit messages.
- No critical bugs or unresolved issues remain in the feature/task.

## Back-End Development
- APIs are fully implemented, tested, and documented.
- API endpoints return expected responses, including error handling.
- Database operations are efficient and secure, following best practices for NoSQL with MongoDB.
- Integration between Flask and MongoDB (via PyMongo) is verified.
- Automated tests cover all critical back-end logic.
- Back-end deployment to Vercel is verified, and APIs are accessible.

## Front-End Development
- User interface (UI) is responsive, clean, and matches the agreed-upon design specifications.
- All components are tested and render correctly in React.js.
- Cross-browser compatibility is verified (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Bootstrap-based styling and customizations are consistent and simple3.
- Front-end integrates seamlessly with back-end APIs.
- Real-time updates and notifications work as expected.

## Features and Functionalities

7. **Kanban Board**
   - Kanban Board is implemented for task management.
   - Task features like ("to do," "in progress," "done") and priority levels can be updated and saved.

## Testing Criteria
- Unit tests have at least 80% coverage for both back-end and front-end.
- Integration tests validate interaction between front-end and back-end components seamlessly.
- Manual testing confirms user workflows function as expected.
- All critical paths are validated, including:
  - Task creation and tracking.
  - User role assignments.
  - Notifications and updates.

## Documentation
- Feature implementation and usage are documented in the repository.
- API endpoints are documented with sample requests and responses.
- Deployment process is outlined for future reference.
- README file is updated with relevant project details.

## Deployment Readiness
